## 🪐Kaizen改善
**`Software Developer`**

*Wanna turn the world upside down with me?*

My name is Mailson, but you can call me Kaizen (改善), which is my favorite Japanese word. It means 'continuous improvement.' Here, you can find some cool projects built from the ground up, starting with planning and design and culminating in solving real-life problems with code.
